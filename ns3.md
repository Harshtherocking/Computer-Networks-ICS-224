#### Find the theoretical transmit time (Tt) for a packet of size 1024 bytes to arrive at the receiver, if the link speed is 5 Mbps and the propagation delay is  2ms?
```cc

```
```console
At time +2s client sent 1024 bytes to 10.1.1.2 port 9
At time +2.00369s server received 1024 bytes from 10.1.1.1 port 49153
At time +2.00369s server sent 1024 bytes to 10.1.1.1 port 49153
At time +2.00737s client received 1024 bytes from 10.1.1.2 port 9
At time +3s client sent 1024 bytes to 10.1.1.2 port 9
At time +3.00369s server received 1024 bytes from 10.1.1.1 port 49153
At time +3.00369s server sent 1024 bytes to 10.1.1.1 port 49153

#### Find the theoretical transmit time (Tt) for a packet of size 1024 bytes to arrive at the receiver, if the link speed is 5 Mbps and the propagation delay is  5ms? Verify and present the terminal  results to show if  Tt  is same/different for Q2. Consider the L3 header to be 20 bytes long and include it in the calculations
```cc

```
```console
At time +2s client sent 1024 bytes to 10.1.1.2 port 9
At time +2.00669s server received 1024 bytes from 10.1.1.1 port 49153
At time +2.00669s server sent 1024 bytes to 10.1.1.1 port 49153
At time +2.01337s client received 1024 bytes from 10.1.1.2 port 9
At time +3s client sent 1024 bytes to 10.1.1.2 port 9
At time +3.00669s server received 1024 bytes from 10.1.1.1 port 49153
At time +3.00669s server sent 1024 bytes to 10.1.1.1 port 49153

#### If the packet of size is  1024 bytes (excluding the header) and the link speed is 10 Mbps and the propagation delay is  5ms, Compare the  observed total delay (Tt +TPD + ?) with the theoretical delay and give your inferences on the difference between the two values? Consider the L3 header to be 20 bytes long and include it in the calculations
```console

```
